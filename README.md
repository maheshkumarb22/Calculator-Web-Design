# Calculator-Web-Design
The Simple Calculator is a web-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project serves as a practical example of how to create an interactive user interface and implement functionality using JavaScript.

Implementation Steps:
1.Create the HTML Structure:

Use <div> elements to create the calculator layout.
Include buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), a clear button, and an equals button.

2.Style the Calculator with CSS:

Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to arrange the buttons in a grid layout.
Style the buttons and display area for a clean and modern look.

3.Add Functionality with JavaScript:

Create functions to handle button clicks and perform calculations.
Update the display area with the current input and results.
